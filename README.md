<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

This package is implementing the metamodel optimization method described
in \[1\]. The aim of this repository is to provide a base sample
implementation that can be used to to train a metamodel based on a given
sample input â€“ output result set then create an optimization model based
on the trained metamodel and finally get candidate input parameters that
will generate any given desired output.

A simple use case for the module consists of 3 steps: 1. initialize the
module object, 2. train the metamodel by supplying training and
validation datasets 3. Use optimization model to create candidate input
parameters given lower and upper bounds and target output

## Install

``` sh
pip install calibrate_simulation
```

## How to use

When creating the optimizer object and initializing the module the user
must choose between implemented two metamodel types and two MIP solvers.
The metamodel types are:

1.  Random Forest based metamodel. (not yet implemented)
2.  Artificial neural network based metamodel.

The available MIP solvers for the optimization step are:

1.  GUROBI solver (To use the GUROBI solver the user hast to provide the
    necessary licenses).
2.  Google OR Tools based SCIP solver.

``` python
import numpy as np

# Random data for example purposes
X_training = np.random.randn(20000,6)
X_validation = np.random.randn(5000,6)
X_test = np.random.randn(4000,6)

Y_training = np.random.randn(20000,9)
Y_validation = np.random.randn(5000,9)
Y_test = np.random.randn(4000,9)

# Initialize the Calibration object 
optimizer = CalibrateSimulation(OptimizerType.OR_TOOLS)

# Train the metamodel 
optimizer.train_model(X_training, Y_training, X_validation, Y_validation)

# 9 sample target values for output
target_sample = np.array([0.72864795, 0.72025004, 0.66572048, 0.68154454, 0.65445883, 0.57947686, 0.60197869, 0.53777778, 0.56603774])

#lower and upper bounds for input values. These values will be used as constraints for the optimization 
lower_bound = [1, 0.5, 5, 1, 0.4, 390]
upper_bound = [2.5, 1, 10, 5, 0.8,760]

# Use selected solver to create and solve the optimization model for given sample target values
result = optimizer.solve_optimization(target_sample,lower_bound,upper_bound)
```
